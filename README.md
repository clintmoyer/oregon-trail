Background On The OREGON Program
--------------------------------

In 1971, Don Rawitsch and Bill Heinemann were participating together in
a practice teaching program as students at Carleton College in Northfield,
Minnesota. Don was teaching a class on the history of the American West
and provided the preliminary information which Bill, a math teacher,
used to construct the OREGON program. The program was first implemented
on the Minneapolis Schools timesharing system. On the completion of the
practice teaching program, the program was removed from the Minneapolis
system and remained only as a curled up listing until Don joined the
MECC staff in 1974 and loaded it onto the MECC system. Don then proceeded
to do further research on the Oregon Trail and modified the program for
historical accuracy to produce the present version. The program has been
implemented on Hewlett-Packard UNIVAC, and Control Data systems.
